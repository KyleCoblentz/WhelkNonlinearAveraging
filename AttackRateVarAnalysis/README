AttackRateVarAnalysis contains:

AttackRateNonlinearAveragingAnalysis which contains code to analyze the whelk data to estimate 
the effects of individual-level attack rate variation on population feeding rates 
and the combined effects of individual attack rate variation and differences among cages in 
resource densities. It requires the .csv's: Feeding_Data_Wide_AllInd.csv, 
Handling_data_AllInd.csv, and ResourceDensityData.csv

Handling_Data_Code contains the code used to create the file Handling_data_AllInd.csv and 
requires FeedingData_Long_Clean
