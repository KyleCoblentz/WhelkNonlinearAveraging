HandlingTimeVarAnalysisCages contains the following:

HandlingTimeSimFunction which defines a function to perform simulations to estimate the
amount by which individual handling time variation would increase population level feeding 
rates

HandlingVarAnalysisCages uses HandlingTimeSimFunction and the data in HandlingAnalysisData.csv
and NucellaHandlingTimes.csv to assess the extent to which individual handling time variation
may have increased population level feeding rates in the field experiment
