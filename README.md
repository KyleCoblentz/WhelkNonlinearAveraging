# WhelkNonlinearAveraging
Data and Code for the analysis of the effects of nonlinear averaging on whelk feeding rates

This repository includes the following folders:

AttackRateVarAnalysis -- includes code and data for estimating the effects of individual level attack rate variation 
on population feeding rates and the effects of individual attack rate variation combined with variation
among cages in resource densities

HandlingTimeVarAnalysisCages -- includes code and data for performing simulations to examine the potential effects of 
individual variation in predator handling times 

LabHandlingTimeAnalysis -- includes code and data for estimating the relationships between predator and 
prey body sizes and whelk handling times
